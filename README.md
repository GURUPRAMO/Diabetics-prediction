# Diabetics-prediction using logistic regression
This project aims to develop a predictive model for identifying individuals at risk of diabetes using __logistic regression__. Logistic regression is a widely used statistical technique for binary classification problems.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains information about various attributes of individuals, such as age, BMI, glucose level, blood pressure, insulin level, etc. Additionally, it includes a binary target variable indicating whether the individual has diabetes or not.
# Requirements
To run this project, you need the following dependencies:
- Python (version 3.0 or higher)
- NumPy
- Pandas 
- Matplotlib


# usage

## Clone the repository:
 ``` git clone https://github.com/GURUPRAMO/Diabetics-prediction.git ```

## Navigate to the project directory:
 ``` pip -r requirements.txt ``` 
``` cd Diabetics-prediction ```
## Run the script:
``` python file.py ```
